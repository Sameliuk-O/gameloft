Question: What is a CSS Grid? Briefly describe its advantages over Flexbox and explain how you would use it to
          create a responsive two-column layout with a sidebar on the left and main content on the right.

Answer:
    CSS Grid is a CSS markup that allows you to create two-dimensional grids (by rows and columns)
    for arranging elements on a page.

    Advantages over Flexbox
                CSS Grid______________________________________________________________Flexbox
        Works in 2 dimensions (rows and columns)_____________|______Works in 1 dimension only (row or column)
        Sets the structure of the entire layout______________|______Controls the placement of elements within a container
        Can accurately distribute elements in two directions_|______Aligns elements along the main axis only


    The advantage of this approach
        Easy layout management without additional wrappers.
        Flexible adaptation to different screen sizes.
        Easy alignment and control over the space between elements.


    CSS Grid is suitable for building complex or two-dimensional layouts, while Flexbox is better used for aligning
    elements within a row or column.

Example:
    <div class="grid">
        <div class="item">1</div>
        <div class="item">2</div>
        <div class="item">3</div>
        <div class="item">4</div>
        <div class="item">5</div>
        <div class="item">6</div>
    </div>

    .grid {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
        grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
    }

    .item {
        padding: 20px;
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
    }
