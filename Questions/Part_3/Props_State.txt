Question: Briefly explain the concept of props and state in ReactJS and how they are used to manage data flow
          within components.

Answer:
    Props are data passed from a parent component to a child component. They are immutable within the child component.
    They are used to configure the component externally â€” for example, to pass a button text or color.

    Example:
        <Button text="Click me" onClick={() => console.log("Clicked")} />
        - text="Click me" - prop
        - onClick={() => console.log("Clicked")} - prop

    State is internal data of a component that can change over time (for example, after a click or text entry).
    Changing the state causes the component to re-render.

    Example:
        const [selectedImage, setSelectedImage] = useState<selectedImageTypes>({img: "", title: ""});
